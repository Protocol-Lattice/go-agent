# Cognitive Swarm â€“ Design Notes

Swarm spaces (SharedSession) act like coordination hubs.
Agents publish findings and consume context scoped to the space.

## Retrieval
- Hybrid RAG + Graph
- Importance, recency, and space scope

## TODO
- Add tokenizer-aware chunking
- Add dedupe (cosine threshold)
